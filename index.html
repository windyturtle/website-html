        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a sophomore at BYU on the path to get a Software Engineering degree.
          I love to code new things and try to learn stuff on my own. I was valedictorian
          of my high school and I am doing pretty well with my grades in my computer
          science classes so far. I have a <b>wife</b>, my high school sweetheart who I married
          on August 20th of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love to go on picnics and try new foods. We also love changing up our "house".
          In this endeavor to change up our living space, I have learned how to put up
          backsplash and how to build a kithen Island
